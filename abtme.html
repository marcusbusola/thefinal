	I am a serial hugger who is in love with problem solving. I live in Lagos where I work as a factotum at the startup I founded with four other friends while still an undergraduate at the University of Lagos. I have a handful of group and personal achievements from both work and academic pursuits (stated in my Resume) which I hope will be a testament to my drive and ability to deliver beyond expectations. I am applying for the Business analyst role and the front end role (both graduate roles) because after going through both job requirements I am convinced that they align (with varying degrees) to my career interests. I am especially excited about the Business analyst role having briefly lived and worked in Dublin in a similar role. I realise also that I have a knack for front end development and have ammased a bit of skill developing and co-developing a number of sites including this one. Some of the work I have done can be seen here.
	Whatever the role that I am considered for is I am convinced that I would be extremely successful at it as I have a track record of turning my convictions into successes. I look forward to your reply.</p></span>
